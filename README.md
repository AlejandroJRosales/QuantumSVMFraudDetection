# Quantum Support Vector Machine Fraud Detection
Applying a Quantum Support Vector Machine for credit card fraud detection in Qiskit. The applied QSVM makes use of quantum enhanced feature spaces optimization based on the research paper, Supervised Learning with Quantum Enhanced Feature Spaces 

Read the amazing original work of the researchers on the paper, Supervised Learning with Quantum Enhanced Feature Spaces. Which you can find here: https://arxiv.org/pdf/1804.11326.pdf

You can read a summary and analysis of the math, circuitry, and quantum mechanics behind the support vector machine with quantum-enhanced feature space on my website here: https://www.context-switching.com/tcs/quantummachinelearning/#quantum-support-vector-machine
